# Sequence Safari



# Problem Statement:

Shubham decided to create a birthday gift for Kevin, who enjoys games with risk and thrill. Shubham needs help making a snake game for Kevin with the given requirements:
Game Logic
   The game comprises a grid where the user controls a snake and moves around the map
   There will be items scattered across the map which the snake can eat
   The snake must eat the items in the correct sequence
   The snake dies when it hits a wall or eats itself.
   Here is a demo to give an idea on how the game works.
Modes:

# Normal Mode:

 - [x] Display a grid of dimensions at least 20 x 20
 - [x] The size of the snake is three tiles long
 - [x] The Snake travels across the map to eat color blocks. The color blocks must be eaten in the correct sequence as displayed.
 - [x] Implement a suitable scoring system
 - [x] Implement a time system: the game continues as long as there is time on the clock. When completing a sequence of blocks, the player gains time.
 - [x] Make the game mobile responsive
 - [x] Implement onscreen direction control to steer the snake
 
 
# Hacker Mode:

 - [x] Implement a lives system: when a snake dies, it loses a life. When all the lives are depleted, the game ends
 - [x] On completing a sequence of blocks, the snake grows in size
 - [x] If the snake eats itself, the game ends
 - [x] Implement sound on snake-eating word
 - [x] Implement variable grid size as per player request
 - [x] Replace color blocks with letters and words to be eaten in the correct sequence
